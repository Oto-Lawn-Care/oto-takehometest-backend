### Take home coding test - Kindle backend

Thank you for chosing to interview with OtO. Below are the instructions for your take home coding test:

1. The details of your task are mentioned in the `TASK.md` file

2. Kindly fork the repository and work off of your fork. Repository link: https://github.com/Oto-Lawn-Care/oto-takehometest-kindle

3. Create a branch off of `master` and work on that. We encourage you to commit and push your changes periodically so we can incrementally look at your changes and thought process. This, however is not a hard core requirement

4. Create a pull request targeting master in your fork once you're done with the complete test

Good Luck! :)
