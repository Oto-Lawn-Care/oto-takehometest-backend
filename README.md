### Take home coding test - Kindle backend

Thank you for choosing to interview with OtO! Below are the instructions for your take home coding test:

1. The details of your task are mentioned in the `TASK.md` file.

2. Create a private fork by cloning this repository, creating a new empty private repository, and pushing your clone to your empty private repository. Please add @mattweason and @pratheek-adi to your private fork.

3. Create a branch off of `master` and work on that. We encourage you to commit and push your changes periodically so we can incrementally look at your changes and thought process. This, however is not a hard core requirement.

4. Create a pull request targeting master in your fork once you've completed the tasks.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions.

Good Luck! :)
